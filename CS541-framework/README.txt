All functions should be implemented, and the only differences between the handout and my implementation are that I use the 'T' instead of 'TAB' to toggle from navigation mode and 'skycam' mode.

Proj 2 - The only special feature is that I used the approximation (GVALUE / (LN * VN)) -> 1 / (LH * LH)

Proj 3 - No special features.  Light distance set to 200.  I do recommend moving / shifting the light so that it's a bit higher in the sky--as is, it's very low and at a very shallow angle to the scene.

Proj 4 = Toggle reflection with the 'R' key

Proj 5 - Bricks texture applied to the podium, doesn't show up on teapot since I don't draw the podium during the reflection step, sky/clouds texture used as skybox
